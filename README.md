# Data Ingestion with LangChain

This repository is designed for learning and experimenting with LangChain, a framework for building applications with language models. The workspace is structured as follows:

## Folder Structure

- **main.py**: The entry point for the project.
- **pyproject.toml**: Configuration file for the project.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the Python dependencies required for the project.
- **uv.lock**: Lock file for dependency management.
- **Data Ingestion/**: Contains the Jupyter Notebook for data ingestion tasks.
  - **dataingestion.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook for exploring and implementing data ingestion workflows using LangChain.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```powershell
   python -m venv .venv
   .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook in the `Data Ingestion/` folder to start exploring LangChain.

## Purpose

This project is aimed at providing hands-on experience with LangChain for data ingestion tasks.
